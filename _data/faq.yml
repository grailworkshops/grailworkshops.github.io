- question: "What kinds of papers fit GRAIL-V?"
  answer: "Work on grounded multimodal retrieval, reranking, and verification for agentic vision-language systems: region/page/moment evidence, hybrid structured+unstructured retrieval, tool use, calibration/abstention, robustness, and deployment efficiency."
- question: "What should I include to make my submission strong?"
  answer: "Clear evidence grounding (citations or region/page/moment provenance), realistic efficiency reporting (latency/memory/cost), and reproducible artifacts with licenses when possible."
- question: "Is GRAIL-V archival?"
  answer: "Yes. Accepted papers appear in the CVPR 2026 Workshop Proceedings (archival)."
- question: "Can I submit non-archival or demo-only work?"
  answer: "Yes. We welcome demos and industry showcases. Indicate this in your submission."
- question: "Are remote presentations allowed?"
  answer: "CVPR policy prefers in-person presentations. Remote exceptions require documentation."
- question: "Do you require code or data release?"
  answer: "Strongly encouraged. Please include artifact links and licenses when possible."
