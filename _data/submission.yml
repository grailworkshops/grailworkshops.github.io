title: "Submission details"
lead: "We invite archival papers and demos on grounded multimodal retrieval, reranking, and verification for agentic vision systems. We especially welcome work that reports grounded evidence (region/page/moment), calibration or abstention behavior, and real deployment constraints (latency, memory, cost)."
