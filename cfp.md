    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">
    At <strong>GRAIL-V</strong> we bring together <strong>CV, IR, NLP, and HCI</strong> communities to advance
    unified methods and evaluation practices for visual–text search, multimodal tool use, and calibrated
    decision-making. This is the <strong>CVPR 2026 workshop CFP</strong> for multimodal generative/understanding models and agents that plan, retrieve, reason and verify with an evidence-centric systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    We invite papers and demos on <strong>grounded vision-language systems</strong> that plan, retrieve, reason,
    and verify with evidence. We welcome submissions that bridge multimodal perception and
    <strong>actionable decision-making</strong>. Please follow the
    <a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2026/AuthorGuidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVPR 2026 author guidelines</a>.

  <!-- <p>
    We focus on systems that don't just see, but plan, retrieve, and verify with precision.
